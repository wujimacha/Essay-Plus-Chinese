# WūJīMāChā Essay+

Since the dawning of the digital era, the living space of man has been gradually and unconsciously replaced by the growing domain of data exchange, solely for the sake of efficiency and functionality. Thinking and Literature, as the most important forms of social life, have become groundless thereby. In order to secure a dwelling place for these activities, we decide to receive contributions (in both English and Chinese) in the name of  WūJīMāChā Essay+, with no limitations on theme, material, and inclination. But the major focus will be on various forms of literature (poetry,  prose, novels) and its criticism, as well as works of thought and its criticism.
<br>數字時代日益加劇，人的生存空間也因而在無形中被縮減，代之以效率化，功能化的數據交換。思想與文藝作為社會生活最重要之形式，逐漸失去了現實的基本。為了在這不期然的境況下讓純粹的精神活動仍能得以表達，我們決定創立 *WūJīMāChā Essay+*。題材、媒介、傾向，俱不設限，但以純文學及其批評，純思想性作品及其批評為主。

We believe that the present age is the same as the past, in which man would have to respond to its essential problems and hidden turbulences with the strength of his spirit.
<br>我們相信如今和過往一樣，人依然需要以心靈本身來回應這個時代所涵攝的困惑，以及隱蔽的動盪。
